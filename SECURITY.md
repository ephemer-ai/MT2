# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The supported versions of MT2 are always the versions under the latest minor release. A Minor release bump signals
sunsetting of security support for older versions. Most users will not ever need to worry about this, as they'll be served the
newest production-released version of MT2 by default.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.5.x   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| < 0.5   | :x:                |
| [MT2 Desktop](https://github.com/ephemer-ai/MT2-archive) | :x:   |
| WinHIVTRACE | :x:   |

Historical projects from which MT2 has evolved are NOT supported. Anyone using these is strongly encouraged to begin
using [MT2](https://MT2.cdc.gov/MT2/) instead.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability in MT2, please [file a security advisory](https://github.com/ephemer-ai/MT2/security/advisories)
or detail it in an email to MT2@cdc.gov. Please **do not** file an
issue report on Github. We'll get back to you as soon as we've attempted to verify the
vulnerability you're reporting. If your report is confirmed, we'll write and release a patch as quickly as we possibly can.
